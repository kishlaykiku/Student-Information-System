# Student Information System - Database and Java Application

## Overview
The Student Information System is a fictional system designed to manage students, courses, teachers, enrollments, and payments. This project is part of an assignment aimed at building a complete database schema for the SIS, along with a Java-based application to manage the operations of the system, such as enrolling students in courses, assigning teachers, and processing payments.

The project is structured into several tasks, each focusing on different aspects, including SQL schema design, SQL queries for data manipulation and retrieval, and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles using Java.

## Tasks

### Database Design

- **Task 1 (Database Design)**: Created a database schema for the Student Information System with tables for Students, Courses, Teachers, Enrollments, and Payments and also inserted values in the tables.
- **Task 2 (SQL Queries)**: Tested SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data.
- **Task 3 (SQL Queries)**: Performed queries using aggregate functions, joins, and GROUP BY.
- **Task 4 (SQL Queries)**: Use subqueries and implement object-oriented programming concepts in Java.
